Embarking on a Web3 journey, one block at a time. I'm a digital explorer diving deep into the decentralized world, documenting my adventures and insights along the way. Currently contributing to DAO Masons, where we're crafting governance solutions with our flagship product, Grant Ships. I've also left my mark at DAOhaus/Public HAUS, Public Nouns, Meta Cartel, Raid Guild, Raid Brood, and a few other corners of the metaverse.

Fascinated by the mechanics behind Web3, I'm all about demystifying the space and paving the way for the next billion users to join the decentralized revolution. Join me as I navigate the wild, weird, and wonderful world of Web3!
